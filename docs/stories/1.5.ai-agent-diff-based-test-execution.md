# Story 1.5: AI Agent Diff-Based Test Execution

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the AI agent to analyze the PR's code changes (the 'diff'),
**so that** it can create and execute a targeted test plan relevant to those changes.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The service calculates the code `diff` between the PR branch and the main branch.
2. The AI agent receives the `diff` as input to generate a dynamic test plan.
3. The agent executes this test plan using the browser automation tool.
4. The agent determines a pass/fail result based on the outcome.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.4: Local simulation runner is operational with Playwright browser automation. Worker processes can execute simulation jobs asynchronously. Repository cloning and branch checkout functionality is working. SQS integration for background processing is established. [Source: Story 1.4 completion notes]

### Data Models
**SimulationJob Enhancement**: Extend existing job model to include diff data and AI-generated test plan. Report field should capture AI reasoning and individual test results alongside overall pass/fail status. [Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**AI Test Plan Structure**: Test plan should contain structured test cases with descriptions, expected outcomes, and execution steps that can be interpreted by Playwright automation. [Source: architecture/components.md#simulation-engine]

### API Specifications
**Existing Endpoints**: No new API endpoints required. Leverage existing POST `/simulations` and GET `/simulations/{jobId}` endpoints. Enhanced job status progression: pending → running → diff_analysis → test_generation → test_execution → completed/failed. [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]

### Component Specifications
**AI Agent Framework**: Use Pydantic AI as specified in tech stack for reliable AI agent implementation. Create Agent with proper typing: `Agent[DiffData, TestPlan]` where DiffData is dependency type and TestPlan is output type. Use `system_prompt` for static instructions and `@agent.tool` decorators for diff analysis functions. Agent should be instantiated once as module global for reuse. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, llms-full.txt]

**Pydantic AI Agent Pattern**: 
```python
from pydantic_ai import Agent, RunContext
from pydantic import BaseModel

class DiffData(BaseModel):
    diff_content: str
    changed_files: list[str]

class TestPlan(BaseModel):
    test_cases: list[dict]
    execution_strategy: str

diff_agent = Agent[DiffData, TestPlan](
    'openai:gpt-4o',
    deps_type=DiffData,
    output_type=TestPlan,
    system_prompt='Analyze code diffs and generate targeted test plans for browser automation.'
)
```
[Source: llms-full.txt Agent examples]

**Diff Analysis**: Use Git command-line tools to calculate diff between PR branch and main branch. Focus on meaningful changes in source code files, excluding configuration and binary files. Pass diff data to Pydantic AI agent via RunContext dependencies. [Source: architecture/components.md#github-service, llms-full.txt]

**Browser Automation Integration**: Extend existing Playwright integration to execute AI-generated test plans. Use agent.run_sync() or agent.run() methods to get TestPlan output, then execute via Playwright. Maintain existing browser automation patterns and error handling from Story 1.4. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, llms-full.txt]

### File Locations
**Service Layer**: Extend `src/services/repository_service.py` for diff calculation. Create new `src/services/ai_agent_service.py` for AI agent logic. Extend `src/services/simulation_service.py` for integration. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Worker Processing**: Extend `src/worker.py` to include diff analysis and AI agent execution in simulation workflow. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

**Test Files**: Create `tests/unit/test_ai_agent_service.py` and extend existing simulation service tests. Follow test directory structure mirroring src/ directory. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Requirements
**Test Strategy**: Use pytest with unittest.mock for unit tests. Mock Pydantic AI agent responses using unittest.mock.patch to avoid external AI service calls. Test agent.run_sync() and agent.run() methods with mocked RunResult objects. Use moto for AWS service mocking. Aim for 80% line coverage. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md, llms-full.txt]

**AI Agent Testing**: Mock Pydantic AI agent responses for consistent testing. Create mock TestPlan objects that match the output_type specification. Test various diff scenarios and corresponding test plan generation. Validate test plan structure matches Pydantic BaseModel schema. Test RunContext dependency injection with DiffData objects. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md, llms-full.txt]

### Technical Constraints
**Pydantic AI Integration**: Use Pydantic AI framework for reliable AI agent implementation. Agent instances should be created once as module globals for reuse (similar to FastAPI apps). Handle AI service timeouts and failures gracefully using try/catch around agent.run() calls. Consider token limits and response time constraints in Lambda environment. Use RunResult.output for accessing validated output data. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, llms-full.txt]

**Git Operations**: Ensure Git diff operations work within Lambda execution environment. Handle large diffs and binary file exclusions. Implement proper timeout handling for Git operations. [Source: architecture/components.md]

**Security Requirements**: Use structured logging for AI agent operations. Handle AI responses securely without exposing sensitive code details. Follow PEP 8 naming conventions and service layer patterns. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Testing
**Test Framework**: pytest 8.0+ with unittest.mock for mocking AI agent and Git operations
**Test Location**: tests/unit/ and tests/integration/ directories mirroring src/ structure
**Coverage Goal**: 80% line coverage enforced by CI/CD pipeline
**AI Mocking**: Mock Pydantic AI agent responses for consistent unit testing
**Git Mocking**: Mock Git command execution for diff calculation testing
**Test Data**: Use pytest fixtures for managing test diffs and AI response data
