# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
* Increase overall developer velocity and improve team morale.
* Reduce the number of production bugs originating from pull requests.
* Decrease the time reviewers spend on each pull request.
* Increase reviewer confidence in the quality and correctness of the code they are approving.

## Background Context
With the rise of AI-assisted coding, developers are producing code at a much higher volume. This often places a significant burden on code reviewers who must validate large amounts of code of varying quality. This inefficiency creates a bottleneck, leading to longer review cycles, developer burnout, and a higher risk of bugs making it to production. Existing tools primarily assist the PR creator, not the reviewer, leaving a critical gap. This document outlines the requirements for "myfav-coworker," a tool designed to directly address this gap by providing powerful, automated assistance to the code reviewer.
